1007141,I enjoy these ones better than any other brand because they are not bulky and they are contoured to my shape. I suffer heavy periods and they are great.,
1007142,"These pads are comfortable but doesn't really 'move with your body'. It also doesn't really absorb as fast as the other pads,but it is pretty good.",
1007143,this product works for me cause I have a heavy flow and it works very well,
1007144,"I like Always maxi pads. I remember when the wings were messy. That was when I was a girl. Always maxi pads are nothing like Pull-Ups training pants. I buy Always maxi pads at Publix. It is good for overnight protection. I use mostly tampons now. In the nighttime I use maxi pads. In the daytime I use tampons. One night my mom thought my older sister said she needed some math pads, but they were maxi pads. Always maxi pads were introduced in the 1980's. I prefer to use tampons. I also like Stayfree maxi pads.",
1007145,"I am a plus size girl and have a heavy flow usually. This product really protects me and I don't leak, not even at night. It covers alot of ground, and absorbs great!",
1007146,"I love these pads. Ever since these started being sold on store shelves, I have been a loyal consumer. I love how comfortable and absorbent they are. It doesn't even feel like you are wearing anything.",
1007147,"I grabbed a box of these thinking they would be the same as the Always Infinity pads, and they very nearly are. Amazing absorption, fairly comfortable, flexible, good coverage. But the 'light clean scent' is offensive and needs to go. Feminine products should NEVER be scented. I'm so tired of trying to remember to check the fine print on products, they shouldn't even be scented in the first place and I don't want to waste money on a product I hate using. I will be avoiding these shiny, purple boxes like the plague in the future.",
1007148,Stop making pads without wings! Honestly nobody buys them! Wasting your money!,
1007149,They were very comfy and they were VERY light I would use them again,
1007150,"I have recently found this pad, and I love how wide it is. I am normally a tampon user, but these pads have left me feeling very protected. I went back to using a Always Long pad and found it so narrow, ha ha! I am not quite a 14+, and I still find them fantastic. They move well with me, and do not leak when I stand up and my flow increases.",
1007151,I have never reviewed before til now! I agree with barbaraann  0%! I feel like I don't even have them on til it starts to overflow! I have been using the Always Ultra Thin Pads or something cheaper and like them. I do like Always Ultra Thins but compared to these (Radiant Infinity)... yea... It's like saying I want a washcloth instead of a towel when I get out of the shower.. which one would you rather use? A towel right?? If you flow heavy these are most likely the pads for you! If you're a light flower well you now have pads that will last you a long time. I know i'm ranting but I love these pads! lol They can be a bit pricey but they're worth it!,
1007152,"I finally have a pad that is long enough to protect me when I sleep. During my last cycle I had to change the sheets because when I rolled over onto my belly in my sleep everything shifted and made a big mess. Last night would have been one of them nights again, but thanks to this super long pad, I woke up with clean panties and sheets!",
1007153,"I have never done a review for a pad before, but I cannot say enough good things about this pad!! After suffering with a suddenly heavy flow that worsens around 2am, and soaking through a super plus tampon and Always Overnight Maxi, I picked up a package of these and I have slept comfortably ever since! No more getting up 3 times a night to change a super plus tampon and overnight pad. I feel so protected, have had no leaks, and they stay where they are supposed to. I tend to leak at the front and they gave me lots of coverage at the front, while keeping my back end nicely covered too. I can sleep in any position I want, without having to worry about leaking everywhere. Yes they are bulky, but I find that reassuring knowing I am covered. I used to stick to Always overnights maxi or Overnights Infinity and I will not go back for the heaviest nights during my cycle. My flow suddenly increased overnight, and the pad held everything. Usually I would be awoken when that happens, but I did not even realize until I got up the next time. The two sets of wings are a lifesaver. I usually have to make a run for the bathroom when I get up to avoid leaks, but I had no such worries, the pad absorbed everything right away. Even my hubby is pleased! I can sleep better, and I am not getting up a million times to see if I am leaking everywhere. I used to be a tampons all the time girl, but you have converted me Always! I picked up the Always Maximum Protection Maxis and Ultra Thins too, and while I would normally never leave the house wearing a pad, I feel so confident in their protection that I spent my whole day running errands using them!",
1007154,"Please bring the plus size pads back. With the plus size pad I was confident that I did not have to worry about leakage, but now I am constantly going back and forth to the restoom. We need this pad back.",
1007155,"The original Always Regular Maxi pads went away? Since when? I switch back and forth between products but I'm quite sure these were still sold at my local supermarket. These work great but I sometimes get bored with the same product, like bar soap. I plan to buy again!",
1007156,"I only just discovered this option last month, and I am so glad I did. -  - I always have to put the green and orange pads on backwards because of flow issues--but with this, even though some of the pad is (as a previous reviewer put it) 'wasted', I can put it on like a normal pad. I LOVE this thing. I can wear it and not worry at ALL about any leaking into my pants in the front OR in the back.",
1007157,Hi. The product itself is very good and very comfortable BUT I object to spending over 33p per pad when their usual products are around 17p per pad (Still too expensive to my mind) -  - So although I really liked these I wont buy them again as they cost far too much.,
1007158,This was FINALLY the pad we all had wanted and it was functional comfortable and reliable. Most other pads are too short and fall off because they were made for toothpicks that bleed a pin drop and are done. BRING BACK THE 14+,
1007159,"I really do encourage girls to buy this,it makes you feel really clean! This helps for sensitive skin.",
1007160,"Only sanitary give me one hundred percent protection through the night, the only product that never let me down, that never leaked and stained my favorite nightwear and bedding. would recommend these sanitary napkins every menstruating girl is inspired by the women completed, full protection like in the bank, despite the size of the high level of comfort is virtually imperceptible",
1007161,"I only use pads at night and just as extra protection with a tampon, so if there's anytime i don't want to wear an uncomfortable pad, it's at night when I'm trying to go to sleep. I usually just bought the cheaper name brand pads, since I don't use them constantly, but bought these when they were on sale and I will never go back to another brand. These pads are so comfortable and flexible; I can barely feel them. The shape of the pad makes it super easy to wear with any kind of underwear. I usually wouldn't even take the time to write a review for a pad that I only use at night, but I am so impressed with these that I had to. If you primarily use pads, do yourself a favor and buy these. It's the first pad I've ever used that didn't just advertise as being super comfortable and absorbent, but WERE super comfortable and absorbent!",
1007162,This is the best pad I have used in ages - the always infinity. It really locks in all the blood and is a superb length (the green wrapped ones). However I noticed they don't grip properly to my net knickers. They do grip well to my cotton knickers . Please a little more sticky tape will help. But anyway thanks for a great product.,
1007163,"I just stared my periods and started using Always Radiant Infinity Teen Pads, and they last up my entire school day and on heavier flow day I just change it more often",
1007164,Always please bring these pads back. Plus size 14+ is what womem want. These are the only pads that work for heavy bleeders.,
1007165,"These pads are NOT 'long'- they are more like a standard 'regular' pad. - I also feel manipulated because they call some 'odor lock', and I thought that was what I was getting. But the ones I bought are called ï¿½dor core`, which really doesn`t mean anything other than like any pad, the smell is initially absorbed but that's it. - So I feel like I have been tricked by false advertising on two levels. - Not impressed. I won`t be buying your products any more. The no name brands are just as good.",
1007166,I usually use 'lightdays' long. I do also occasionally use your product. I use your regular pads. I have now purchased this mega box of liners at Costco-they were labelled as 'long'. They are NOT long!!!! They also seem cheaply made for a name brand product. There is alo confusion as to 'odor lock' vs 'odor control'. I feel likeI am being manipulated and messed with. I won't be buying these again. I probably won't buy any of your products again.,
1007167,They are almost perfect - the best pad in terms of shape and absorbency. Even compared to the large ones with wings. So comfortable. But why the yucky baby powder fragrance? It's unpleasant and doesn't need to be there. Please make a version without it!!!,
1007168,"It's thin,soft,so absorbent, I'd recommend Infinity to any girl asking for recommendation. Best pad EVER. Period.",
1007169,testtesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttest,
1007170,"These pads are the only ones that don't make me leak. They absorb a lot but the pad's wings are annoying. I have a normal to heavy flow and i usually have to change my pad every 2 - 4 hours but these pads give me at least 6 hours or more. Try these pads, you will not regret buying them.",
1007171,"I don't buy anything, but always because they work for me. I won't use any other brand of pads.",
1007172,"I was at first reluctant to buy this product because it was a bit higher than the regular always pads. I don't like to by the cheapo brands (because they don't work) but I also like to save money. But eventually, I decided to spring on them (with a coupon). I found this particuliar Always product ot be more absorbant. I have a heavy cycle and just thought that I would have a life time of tiny accidents on my two heavest days. At the very least, I have to use tampon/pad combo and go through the two in one hour time. Not the case anymore! I can now sleep through the night with no worries, regardless of my flow...with just the pad! They are super absorbant, they wick the unpleasantness (including moisture) away from your body, and they have an awesome odor guard. NO more accidents (not even at night), NO more frequent changes every hour upon the hour, and NO more tampons! WORTH the extra cents!!!",
1007173,"Always Maxi Long Super Pads are the only ones I use. A few months back, I began using Poise liners between periods to help with my LBL. They work, but are not as comfortable as my Always. And for my LBL, these Always work just as well if not better. And are comfortable! Great product! For all of my needs. Thanks!!",
1007174,"I have heavy flow, but also need a pad that can deal with odors. This pad is perfect for me. It's comfortable and it works.",
1007175,"The pad absorbs a lot of liquid.. HOWEVER you never see how much it absorbed until you take it off and look at the back.. Which is why some individuals have had accidents.. The liquid disperses throughout the pad, showing very little on top.. This can be difficult to get use too...or judge when to actually change the pad.. HOWEVER once the learning curve is mastered, this pad is THE BEST EVER!!! So breathable, flexible, soft, not irritating, and never smells bad...",
1007176,I just bought these and wore it the WHOLE school day (8 hours) and it still was dry to the touch! I wished they made these without wings though!!!,
1007177,PLEASE BRING THIS PRODUCT BACK! I HAVE BOUGHT THE INVENTORY AT EACH STORE I CAN FIND THEM AT! -  - PLEASE RECONSIDER. -  - THANK YOU!,
1007178,I tried these pads for the first time since I had a coupon. I landed up with a terrible rash and infection. The doctors told me that the chemicals used in this product are so harsh that they caused irritation. Will never go back and use any type of Always products again.,
1007179,I used to break out in a rash when I used Always....... but recently my regular store stopped carrying the overnight pads I used...... So I tried your overnights and WOW!! I have never used a pad that even starts to cover the spots yours hits!!! And thankfully no more rash!! I have to say thank you for saving my new sheets!! Thank you for offering a product that provides the protection I need!!!,
1007180,this is best pad ever for any one if the have light to regular period they last for ever five hours. and know will ever tell your on your period. Buy them there is nothing bad about them for teens,
1007181,"Great absorbency and flexibility but so much that it doesn't stick down! The sticky strip is not wide enough that remains it in place and the wings don't either. It is such a shame, because the feel is great, yet I have to reduce comfort and safety because it comes unstick. Disappointing. If only they stayed!",
1007182,"I'm constantly changing these, changing my sheets, etc.!!! The design is bad. You end up with more flow at the top of the pad, nothing on the back. You end up w/ a 1/4 pad used up and have to change and waste it. You're throwing away almost a clean pad minus the front area.",
1007183,asasasasaswqwqwqwqwqwqwqwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww,
1007184,"I am a soccer player and when I have my period its not comfortable to run in pads, and I don't wear tampons but these pads are so comfortable and I barley feel anything at all. They are super light, absorbent, and I definitely recommend these to all athletic women/girls! :)",
1007185,"As with the other reviewers, I have to spend quite a bit of time (hours in total) attempting to remove the adhesive that rips off when removing these pads - and most often, I can't get it all. Have used nothing but ALWAYS products but will be trying others because these have ruined my brand new panties.",
1007186,It's unbelievable how comfortable it is. It honestly doesn't even feel like you're wearing one at all!,
1007187,"Over the years, I've searched for pad that fits my body type but could not; then recently I started using Always Infinity Overnight, seriously I can't believe that am wearing a pad with this product. Now, I don't have to worry about leakages and embarrassing stains on my bedspread; plus it feels light so like feather and soft like a baby cushion.",
1007188,I just got my period and I found these in my local store so I tried them. They are really good. I don't even think anyone could tell I had my period! :),
1007189,"I recommend this product to girls because it's more comfortable and absorbs your blood flow. It's more convenient than a tampon. A tampon is ALOT to manage. U DONT FEEL like yourself in a tampon. Words cant describe how I feel about GIRLS buying this excellent, convenient and cheap money pad. U could pay LIKE 1.00 for this at Wal-Mart and I promise you you'll look at it and say holy moley this is a great pad.",
1007190,This was my very first pad and I loved it. It soaks up very quickly unlike another pad I have tried that made you feel like you were just sitting in the blood. I definitely recommend this product! This is the only pad I will ever use,
1007191,"its very thin and flexible. Its great, i just don't like that it's scented",
1007192,"As much as I really appreciate the odor control, the lack of absorbency was rather disappointing. This particular pad seems to leave you feeling icky and slimy. The original Maxi pads, however, are the best Always has ever made. I guess you cannot improve on perfection! Well, almost perfect by my opinion! : )",
1007193,"I have been using the Always brand ever since I first started my period. I tried Kotex once because they had nothing else in the store, and there literally is no comparison. So when it came time to buy some more, I looked to Always. When I saw the Radiant pads, I thought I'd try them out. They were a tiny bit more, but I didn't mind. These are definitely the best pads I've ever used! I was genuinely surprised at their absorbency considering how thin they are. You can throw one in your purse and not have it take up any space. I barely know it's there and it gives me the freedom to move around the way I want without worry. Definitely worth the buy!",
1007194,I can 'always' depend on no leak protection with this product. But lately I cannot find it in any of my local stores. I used to be able find it at CVS and Fred's.,
1007195,I just got my period at   I needed a pad. I'm 5 - feet tall and these workout for my size.,
1007196,"Always has always been my favourite. They are thin and once they adapt to your body temp they are pretty flexible and mold to you. The length is good but the width could be a bit smaller but I am a fairly small person. The absorbancy is great is doesn't sit on the top of the pad and doesn't leak through. Does not feel like I am wearing a diaper. - For me however they give me a pretty bad reaction, gives me an embarrassing itch. so I only use them for a couple hours to give my body a break from tampons. PLEASE look into why it would give a reaction and fix. Then I will give it 5 stars.",
1007197,"I have recurring bacterial vaginosis, which means I deal with unpleasant feminine odor often. It's an embarrassing and uncomfortable problem. These pantiliners make life a lot easier for me. They absorb odor reliably so I know I'm protected for hours at a time. They absorb moisture well so I stay comfortable. I don't have to wonder if anyone can smell anything or worry that I'll need to change it frequently.",
1007198,"I am a plus sized woman with heavy flow. This is the only pad that meets my needs. I am in tears now that I can no longer find it in stores. Back will be the days of soiling my work uniform and struggling to tie a jacket around my waist until I can get to my car for my back up pair of pants and underwear. And no I'm not being dramatic. This has happened to me 4 times at work. My work uniform consists of khaki Dockers style pants so you can imagine how embarrassing could be. It's very hard to feel confident and secure knowing that your pad could be leaking. And to make matters worse, I am a 911 dispatcher who works very long hours and frequently can't get up to go to the bathroom for extended periods of time. My only gripe with this pad is the adhesive that I often have difficulty removing from my underwear. Other than that, this product has been a godsend and I urge you to revamp and return it to the market as soon as possible",
1007199,"I don't use pads anymore, but when I did these were the only ones small enough. My only complaint would have been the lack of different absorbencies. Just because someone is petite doesn't neccessarily mean they have a light flow!",
1007200,"My partner picked these up for me, had I noticed they were actually scented I wouldn't have bothered even trying them, but I was desperate! NEVER again!!! - I didn't even last the whole day before having to rip these away from my sensitive area - why would anyone think it's a good idea to put scented products in contact with our most sensitive body parts?? Will NOT be buying again and will definitely not be recommending any of this range to anyone... not even my worst enemy!!",
1007201,"I have tried several brands of pads, and the Always Long Super Maxi (no wings) are the only pads I can trust. They are super-absorbent and comfortable.",
1007202,I JUST started using these when Wal-Mart decides not to sell them anymore. I love these pads so much..I'm not plus size but I just like the wider style pad so these were great for me. The adhesive? Not a fan..thats my only gripe. Please say you are making a name change and are bringing them back to stores!!,
1007203,"These are great. However, I do not like how they are tapered at the front/ top of the pad.I always feel like I am going to leak when they are like that..but other than that they are very comfortable and have no problems with these!",
1007204,"Tried this out because I couldn't find my usual pad brand, and these are awesome! The absorbency is great and it doesn't feel heavy or wet after a long time. The scent is also very nice and eliminates odors. Super comfortable and never had any leakage with these.",
1007205,"Since using this product, I have noticed a considerable difference in absorbancy and odor control compared to other Always products, Kotex and pharmacy brand (like CVS). They are a great length and do not shift. I do wish they came individually wrapped to be discrete but that's an easy fix by keeping them in my small cosmetic bag in my purse.",
1007206,These are great if you are still in school. Whenever I'm switching from a pad to a tampon blood is everywhere so I clean up with these and I'm ready. I love how the scent covers up the blood stench. The wipes smell kina like apples. The only bad thing is that it doesn't really absorb the blood,
1007207,"I have extremely heavy periods (lucky me every other week). I've tried them all. Tilted uterus so tampons/Insteads aren't an option. -  - I like the length and the feel of their outter cover and so far no reaction to their adhesive (yeah, a lucky allergy of mine). -  - Dislikes: not that absorbing (changing them hourly or a massive mess), too wide - by about 1/2 - 3/4 an inch easily for me, almost impossible to find unless you want the lemon cleaner scented ones (yeah NO - wrong on so many levels). -  - In general I just expected them to last longer than an hour - being for Extra heavy/ overnight/ maxi pads and I believe the most absorbent ones Always makes. I know no product will meet my needs for overnight but, to use industrial size box pack per period gets a bit tiresome.",
1007208,I use these on medium days. Very soft and comfortable!,
1007209,"With a heart condition that requires blood thinning medication, it makes for extremely heavy periods. I had resorted to buy both regular pads for lighter days and adult bladder protection undergarments for the worst days. Now I only have to have the Always for the entire deal. Less money spent in the store and I don't have to spend time walking around with an adult diaper on.",
1007210,This pad is great!!! I have regular leakage and need to wear a pad every day but go with out because i cant find a pad im comfortable in. I was skeptic about trying this pad but when i went to purchase my monthly stock my usual brand was sold out. So was this brand (i had to get sented ones vs. unsented). so i bought the Always Infinity scented regular flow. Oh man its so comfy! It doesnt bunch like my previous pad. And the scented helps with odorbock. The price is a bit more but for the comfort im willing to pay a couple extra bucks. Very good product. Where the heck was this pad during my high school years?!,
1007211,"I don't know if Always discontinued this pad, but like the other reviewers I can't find it anywhere anymore; I had finally found a pad that saved me money on having to buy new sheets, panties, and clothes due to unexpected spills, that I would pay any amount of money to buy it, and now they are no where to be found. If Always discontinued this product it surely is a huge mistake on their part. I have fibroids so I have always had heavy periods, even when I was thin, and this pad is better than anything I have ever tried, and now I am back to spending a load of money on new panties, sheets, and clothes again. Please bring back the 14+ pads, I beg you.",
1007212,"I haven't been able to find these in the last 6 months or more. I agree there is too much adhesive on the wings, but that should be easy to fix. Why are they no longer available?",
1007213,I love this product. Been wearing it daily for years. I am very disappointed and do not see why Always stopped making it, especially after reading the other reviews noting how much women love this product. -  - Always - please bring back this product!
1007214,I have been using Always ultra thins for over 15 years. I love love this pad but I really wish that the regular ultra thins that are unscented had this top cover. Not sure what happened with the unscented but they give me irritation now every time I use them. Please consider putting this cover on all of the ultra thins.,
1007215,"I love them, I actually look forward to my period so I can abuse them",
1007216,"As I am rather stout, I need theextralong - alright, However, you had one that was - extra long + 14 that were a very good - length for me. Can't seem to find them - anywhere. Why did you stop making - that kind. I am sure I am not the only - one that needs this extra long + 14 size. - Thanks for helping me out, if you can - tell me why or where they might be - found. Thanks Pauline.",
1007217,"I am a middle age,heavy set woman and have essure as a birth control method. My menstrual flow became heavier and I was having to wear two of the always long pads at one time for complete protection. This product has given me complete protection from front to back. For a woman my size it is very comfortable, flexible, and keep me dry. Thanks.",
1007218,"I love this product. As a teenager, at first I started out by picking the prettiest box. I have tried many pad but they all feel like I'm wearing a diaper. NOT this pad, it is by far my favorite pad ever! I barely notice the pad is even there! Incredible product and I recommend it to women of all ages.",
1007219,Great protection and very confy! I love them! - I do not have to worry about my mattress. Before I had to clean it but these towels are PERFECT the ideal size and shape!,
1007220,My daughter just turned twelve and started her cycle. These pads really work great for her. she has tried others and by far this is the best.,
1007221,"I don't recommend this pad for those who have heavy flow, but other than that this is a great pad. Can't feel it in your undies!",
1007222,"I really liked how comfortable these pads were, but that's about the only good thing. They don't absorb well at all. Even the overnight ones leaked. Then right after using a new one I had another leak. Not great. Regular always all the way.",
1007223,I LOVE THESE PADS!! - NO LEAKS AND VERY COMFORTABLE!,
1007224,"These pads are focused far too much on the back wings at the expense of protection in the front. Knock-off versions of these pads are much better and allow you to adjust placement forward so if you sleep on your side and front, like I do, you don't have an overnight overflow that requires you to strip the bed first thing in the morning. In 30 years this is the worst malfunction ever. If I could return for a refund, I would, but I will never buy this brand of pad again.",
1007225,"I use these pads every time I am on my period, they are very absorbent and comfortable, sometimes I don't even realize I'm on my period. I would definitely recommend these pads.",
1007226,I was not aware they came without wings. LOVE the pad hate the wings! They leave you feeling dry all the time. Now wheres the tampons?,
1007227,"Easy to use, nice and discreet, and really lovely, light scent. Ideal for very sensitive skin. I'm allergic to everything and have no issues with these, at all. They are my must-always carry, go to item.",
1007228,IK I RATED EVERYTHING but I never tried these. I just wanted to say I bought the U kotex pads and they suck! They cam with wings and they're soooooooooooooooooo uncomfy! It makes me so >:(,
1007229,"I have been told to try out this product and that these pads are very comfortable and easy to deal with at schools. They do have wings,but if you open the pad at home there's a piece of tape you can tape back on so its not as loud to open at school.:-) this pad holds a lot of blood and is very flexible I recommend this pad  0 percent. :-) :-) :-). :-) :-) :-) -",
1007230,"When I first brought this product, I wasn't sure how good it was going to be or if it was even the right product for me. But, after one use I felt this was the perfect product for my needs, and the fresh scent just makes it even better! Now I have no stains on my panties or anywhere and no odor. The extra layers of thickness of the pad makes it have great absorbency unlike other types. I definitely love this product and will continue to buy.",
1007231,"I love the fact that they finally made something close to what I need. It is perfect during the night, other than the fact I have to put a smaller pad in the front and the back. I think they shortened the length of the pad which sucks! I loved this pads, and I still like them more than most but they appear to be cheaper made. They give me a rash if I wear them for to long also. I enjoy having a better nights sleep and not having to worry about the hassle and mess or changing my pad every few hours, but I still worry. It wasn't a problem at first, but they changed them!",
1007232,"I've 5'1' and slender. These are by far the VERY BEST pads. The other pads are way too long and thick. These are the other hand are perfect! They don't hold quite as much as some of the bigger pads, so I just change them a little more frequently. But again, BY FAR the best pads if you are slender.",
1007233,"I love that these pads offer length without the bulk! I have a heavy flow, going through menopause as well. These pads protect my clothing, and also fits me well, which it's usually hard to find a good fit when your a full size woman.",
1007234,"The adhesive is too sticky, whenever I go to remove the pad, the adhesive part sticks to much to my underwear causing it to rip part of the pad whenever I take it off. I have to pick the stuck adhesive part of my underwear using hot water to get it off as I couldn't get it off without it & also the inside of the pad that came out on my floor bloodstains and all I have to clean up. Its disgusting & too much of a hassle to buy again. I am throwing these away & buying the competitors, what a waste of money!!",
1007235,"I bought this pad while at Wal-mart. I thought, 'I am very active and am interested in changing pads just to see if this is better than their always maxi with flex wings.' I cannot believe what happened. My flow went up and out the top. I have NEVER had this happen before. So glad I was at home and not out when this embarrassment happened. I will never by this product again.",
1007236,"It's so comfortable and absorbent, I can't tell it's there. I have a heavy flow, but with this pad it doesn't really matter because it soaks it up so well. They cost more than other pads, but it is worth it.",
1007237,"When these first came out I was ready to be wowed....I left mine in the gym bathroom for others. Their uncomfortable, not flexible, doesn't fit to my body... - Just say no. -  - I'll stick w/ the ultra thins",
1007238,"There is nothing better out there. Comfort, absorbency, flexibility all in one.",
1031929,"I am amazed that these diapers actually last up to 12 hours! Our little boy sometimes sleeps  -12 hours at night, and I don't have to worry about leaks or diaper rash! These diapers are amazing!",
1031930,I love pampers they have been with me since day 1. They keep everything in.,
1031931,I only buy this because there is nothing else out there.,
1031932,This item is a little pricey however they are great and keep babies dry especially at night.,
1031933,good diapers they are very soft and don't break out baby's skin. I like the stripe that turns blue when the baby is wet. I also like that they don't leak like other diapers i have tried.,
1031934,"We used size N and 1 Swaddlers for our kiddo, and were completely happy with the fit and absorbency. However, when we jumped up to the size 2 we have not been as impressed. He's had more 'blow out' dirty diapers, where things leaked around the edges. I acknowledge this is probably more because of the shape/size of our kid and is NOT because of a design flaw in the diapers themselves. Still, it is something we've had to deal with.",
1031935,These diapers are the best! I have used them since my daughter was born and they are the most absorbent around. She can wear them overnight without any leaks. We tried other brands and they just didn't work as well at the pampers. We will stick with this brand for a long time!,
1031936,the best all day diapers for our growing 1 year old. keeps him dry all day long.,
1031937,"First, these aren't my favorite wipes. I truly (TRULY) prefer wipes that have texture because texture really grabs onto the mess you are wiping off your baby. These wipes are smooth and I have found that instead of the usual 2 wipes with a patterned wipe that I use 4 - 5 wipes. Since this is a preference thing, I still gave it 4 stars. - My baby had a touch of diaper rash and used these and they were great. They didn't irritate things and he healed up in a few days. The smell is very mild. - The only con is that they leave a slightly slimey reside on your hands and I presume your baby. I don't know if that is due to some time of skin conditioner that is added. - Overall, definitely use if your baby is sensitive or has a rash.",
1031938,"We used cloth diapers and cloth wipes, and it worked --for a while. It was too much work washing and folding diapers and wipes every other day, and wondering if my baby was getting clean enough. We switched to Pampers diapers and wipes, and have been impressed with how gentle the wipes are.",
1031939,"These diapers (overall) are great. They are soft, but gave my daughter a very bad rash. I do not feel this is the diaper's fault, as they never gave my son a rash. They also don't keep her as dry as I feel they should. She is only   weeks old and we switched to Pampers Baby Dry and those seem to be working much better for her. Great for daytime use though.",
1031940,Wow! diapers sure have changed since I used them for my girls. I now am using them on my grandson. I love the mesh lining. It keeps so much from coming back on his little bottom!,
1031941,These are the best diapers for babies with sensitive skin. Love these!!!!,
1031942,Best overnight diapers for a growing 1 year old boy. Keeps him dry at night and no more leaks.,
1031943,Our Princess Stinky Bottom's little tushie is super sensitive. When we found out we were pregnant we decided to us Pampers' Sensitive no matter what...we are sure glad we did!,
1031944,"Soft, comfy and love the indicator best diaper for us",
1031945,"I was determined to use cloth diapers, but after multiple leaks and diaper rashes I was done. We switched to Pampers Swaddlers, and are so happy. Our baby is dry, diaper rash free, and happy. He sleeps better at night, and so do we--knowing that he is dry and comfortable.",
1031946,"I will really recommend this product, to all of my friends, having twins, and buying diaper for two, can get really expensive, but with pampers, they are always very dry, and I don't have to keep changing their diapers as often, so I really recommend this product.",
1031947,"I have fund that Pampers brand keep my baby's butt dryer then other diapers. This is especially good at bedtime. My daughter is a sensitive sleeper and Pampers help keep her dry and sleeping at time. I would definitely recommend Pampers to anyone with a baby, toddler or bed wetter.",
1031948,They're great for toddlers. The price though is a bit outrageous for the few diapers that come in a box.,
1031949,"Great for size N up to 2. When they start to crawl the diaper moves around to much and we had leakage. Also at night when my son got to stage 3, there wasn't enough absorbency to make it through the night.",
1031950,Pamper's Cruiser's fit my daughter very well with no bunching. The diapers had a cute design and did not have a strange smell about them when wet. My daughter seems comfortable and stays dry. Pampers Cruisers are a brand I will continue to use until my daughter is no longer in diapers.,
1031951,"My older son before starting potty training would leak through his diapers over night, there was just to much urine for a regular diaper to contain. I used these until he was potty trained and never had issues again.",
1031952,Pampers Swaddlers are hands down the best diaper on the market. The wetness indicator is a great tool so there is no guessing as to whether the diaper needs to be changed. The fit is great and seems to have more room than the other brands. This is the brand used in most hospitals nationwide and that alone should speak for itself.,
1031953,I have tried other products that were given as gifts. They do not compare to the quality of pampers. I would recommend this product to any parent,
1031954,"For little one this products works well, but if for 2 years toddler is not so good. I rather use the baby dry diaper.",
1031955,Don't depend on them for naps. Only use for minute increments.,
1031956,I love the swaddlers line. I would definitely recommend.,
1031957,"I frankly don't have lots of experience with other brands, but if it ain't broke, then don't fix it. The hospital started us on Pampers and we've been with them since. No problems or complaints with them.",
1031958,"Currently use these for my 1,5 year old. Great fit, don't remember last time I had a leak even when sleeping long nights with big loaded diapers in the morning. He could move around and be comfortable in these. I feel these don't smell as much as some diapers even when soiled. This is the diapers I used for the longest period of time for my kids, great value since they are cheaper than some of the other pampers.",
1031959,The first diapers ever used on my little guy and I will never change they are perfect!!,
1031960,"My baby has worn these for nearly a year and though I've tried other brands, these consistently keep him dry all night. I love the wetness indicator, something that wasn't around with my first child. I subscribe to these on Amazon and have them delivered to my doorstep every month. The price is comparable with other big name brands. - *Newborn blowouts do leak, especially if breastfed, but that seemed true of every brand I tried. My baby is 11 months and hasn't had a true blowout in nearly 6 months. - I will continue with the Pampers line until my baby is potty trained.",
1031961,"Pampers diapers really worked for our newborn. The fit was perfect. We tried huggies, but they leaked out the side. Pampers are the right diapers for us!",
1031962,For my newborn these were the best! Our favorite by far.,
1031963,I love the wetness indicator. It takes the guess work out of diaper changing.,
1031964,"They stay moist and are easy to use. because of the moisture, it wipes better than other brands.",
1031965,"Keep him dry, no leakage, no skin irritation in 4 months. The fit is great, not too bulky! With coupons better cost than off brands. Love them",
1031966,Used these at the beach and in pools. Never had a leaking problem. My kids have always seemed comfortable in them even when wet.,
1031967,I like crusiers but I think swaddlers and baby dry are more absorbant.,
1031968,These are great!! They keep everything inside and don't have to be changed as often as other swimmers.,
1031969,"My twins were born premature and the preemie sized diaper fit them perfectly and we still use them today, except they are in size 4 cruisers now! I've never been a big fan of baby dry, but the swaddlers and cruisers are so absorbent I've never felt like we needed to use baby dry.",
1031970,"I always use pampers swaddlers for my babies when they're under 6 months old - and now (with new sizes) I can use them for at least a year! They keep baby dry as to avoid diaper rash, and the indicator is especially nice.",
1031971,"These are hands down the best diaper all around. My only complaint is the cost is a little high. But they are great for sensitive skin. They don't stick to the skin like some diapers can. The aesthetics are lovely too... nice scent, peaceful pastel colors and nature designs.",
1031972,This is a wonderful diaper! My son can spend all night in these diapers.,
1031973,I have always chose Pampers. My kids like the characters and I'm happy with the way they fit.,
1031974,When potty training my 2 year old I used these to make it easier to pull up and down when you bring them in the bathroom frequently. I actually would prefer pull ups not to have 'fun' characters since my goal is for the child not to want to wear the diaper and put on underwear instead. It is a great product and I am sure it works great for people that don't want accidents. I only used these for a short period of time and decided that he would learn from accidents and let him only have underwear instead.,
1031975,"I love swaddlers, they keep your baby dry. I like the wetness indicator. I'm glad they've increased the size!",
1031976,I always choose Pampers over any other brand.. They are perfect for my overactive children.,
1031977,Pampers sensitive wipes are a good value. My son's delicate baby skin has never had any bad reactions with this product!,
1031978,Me encantan los nuevos panales pampers ya que mantienen a mi bebe siempre seca,
1031979,"I Love How Soft Thes Wipes Are. Keeps My baby's Bottom Clean And A The Scent Isn't Strong. In Fact, There Is Barely A Scent At All! These Wipes Are So Soft That I Use Them To Take Off My Make Up. The Only Kind Of Wipes I Would Use For Anything!",
1031980,"My husband and I love the wetness indicator. We accidently bought a package of diapers without the wetness indicator and we were lost. We swore we smelled something all the time! The Absorb Away liner is the best! My daughter stays dry during those moments when I can't change her right away, like the car ride home! I don't know what I would have done without these diapers!",
1031981,"We received a TON of pampers swaddlers as baby shower gifts. We went through only one package before we realized it was no coincidence that our son's skin was breaking out in a rash from front to back when we were using these diapers. Pampers swaddlers sensitive are a better choice to avoid the rash, but are more expensive. Our local crisis pregnancy center benefitted from our son's skin reaction, as we donated all of our pampers diapers to them!",
1031982,I give it a 5 in all areas except Dryness. My reason for giving it a 4 for Dryness is due to the fact that my 1 year old wakes up most mornings waterlogged with wet pajamas. I even reduced his bedtime liquids with no change in the results. A great product otherwise!!,
1031983,"These were the first diapers we bought and we stuck with them since! No leaks, no diaper rash, no problems. Worth more than the bargain brand for sure!",
1031984,We used pamper's sensitive wipes right away. I have sensitive skin so I thought she might too. Well I was right to do so. The first time grandma watched her she use a generic brand of wipes. My daughter got a rash immediately from it. We weren't sure that caused until it happened again the next time grandma watched her. After getting grandma to switch to the pamper's sensitive wipe she no longer got a rash.,
1031985,The swaddlers diapers are great all around. I love the new diaper smell and they are comfy for baby. I like the sensitive type best but these would be my second choice.,
1031986,"We love Pampers Baby Dry! We've never had a leak which means they fit perfectly and they have great absorbancy even throughout the night when she was younger. Now that she sleeps very long stretches at night we use Pampers Extra Protection (also an amazing diaper line, but that's another rave review for another time). Our little one can happily enjoy her busy, wiggly, on the move day without a care in the world - comfy and dry all day long.",
1031987,"I love Pampers Swaddlers and was excited when they decided to go up to size 5. I was worried about having to switch when my daughter grows out of size 3, but do not have to worry anymore. -  - The new diapers are more absorbent and keep my daughter dry day and night. I also like the wetness indicator strip and was glad they continued with sizes 4 and 5. -  - l definitely recommend Pampers Swaddlers.",
1031988,"When my husband and I first had our son, we had been given a bunch of diapers as shower gifts. Whenever we tried to use Huggies or another off brand our son ALWAYS ended up peeing through all his clothes. Pampers were the only diaper that always worked on keeping us all dry  0% of the time!",
1031989,We had a premie and used newborn diapers for almost 2 months. They fit so nice and loved the quality.,
1031990,Pampers is the only brand of diapers we use for my 2 year old and newborn. Great products all the way around!,
1031991,"We have one twin with ultra sensitive skin prone to rash, so we have to be careful about what we use for her frequent changes. The Sensitive wipe is one of the best we've encountered and we know we can trust it to not irritate her skin as it is alcohol and fragrance free. Mom also appreciate the new packaging so she can read her rewards numbers!",
1031992,"I always have these on hand when I am out and about with the kids, works great not just to change diapers but also clean of little hands at the park before snack time or for spills in the car when out and about. I have tried different brand wipes but I don't like the smell and texture of other brands tested. Stuck with Pampers",
1031993,"We received several brands of diapers at baby showers for my now 9-month old. Like many rookie moms, I opened all the packages and stocked all the diapers perfectly in the nursery. Once my son arrived, his skinny little legs caused leak problems in most of the diapers, the Snugglers were the only thing that worked until he grew some meat on those bones! Now we are up to baby dry.",
1031994,"Pampers Swaddlers are a wonderful product that keeps baby dry. I have used them on both my girls since birth:) They have never let me down, even with baby blow outs. I still use them on my 8 month old!",
1031995,"For both of my children, I have used Pampers. They are a great quality product. We tried a couple different brands when my oldest was a baby, but found them to be to tight, not as absorbent and the quality was not good. When we found pampers, we never looked back!",
1031996,I use these diapers for overnight. Regular diapers just could not last long enough for his sleep pattern. With the Pampers Extra Protection he no longer wakes up to wet bed cloths!,
1031997,I really loved pampers until I discover d targets up and up diapers. Having a newborn I used pampers for the first 3 months. . Just gets expensive. Overall great quality,
1031998,These are by far my favorite and my #1 choice. They definitely live up to their name. I just wish they had a bigger box available!,
1031999,"One of our twins has to be changed constantly for fear of diaper rash, but with Swaddlers we rest mostly comfortably knowing she'll be protected her 12 hours sleep at night in a Swaddler diaper. Mom and Dad appreciate the extra sleep too.",
1032000,I tried others and went back to Pampers. My baby stay dry. I have only had a couple of leaks ever with 2 babies (currently 15 and 31 months).,
1032001,Our son was ten pounds at birth so he has been in size three cruisers for months already! I love the way they fit and how they keep him dry.,
1032002,Used these for my boys when they were newborn. Felt it was important to use baby laundry detergent so why use wipes with fragrance that could irritate their sensitive skin. I never had any problems with rash from the wipes. The wipes are soft and cleans well.,
1032003,"I have a small 5 month old baby boy, and these diapers leak out much quicker than the Swaddlers do for us. They do not last 12 hours--maybe half that. These just do not work for us.",
1032004,I like the swaddlers because they are super absorbent. I also love the little line that changes color when baby is wet. They are good overnight pampers as well - I don't have a sopping wet baby in the morning. I'm happy they have bigger sizes too!,
1032005,These diapers were so wonderful during our first weeks at home with our son. The softness and witness indicators were big bonuses.,
1032006,My daughter was a happy baby. She never cried when she wet her diapers. She slept through the night early on. Even after she wet her diapers she felt dry. I LOVE the indicator stripe letting us know when to change her. Very awesome! My daughter is tall and skinny. We weren't always able to go just by weight suggestions for diaper size we sometimes had to go up a size earlier because of her height. The only time we had problems with leaks were when needed to go up in a size.,
1032007,"My husband and I absolutly LOVE these diapers,we ahve always started with pampers since the birth of our baby and will NOT use anything but.",
1032008,I loved these diapers for my newborn. They never leaked and provided the comfort he needed.,
1032009,I tried a couple different brands of newborn diapers trying to find the best one for my son. The only brand I bought more of and continue to use is Pampers Swaddlers!,
1032010,Great over night diapers! Most absorbent diapers I've ever used. Fit is good.,
1032011,Pamper Swaddlers was a great fit & kept my little one dry.,
1032012,"Bringing home a new baby, you want to use the most softest and gentlest products on them. Pampers Sensitive worked great. They were extra soft and absorbent. The fit was wonderful too. Perfect for the new addition.",
1032013,I used the swaddles for both my boys when they were newborn. Umbilical cord cut out is great since you don't have to fold the diaper down. Kept the boys dry and happy!,
1032014,My daughter has very sensitive skin. We try other diaper from pampers and other brands and always go back to these. I love the wetness indicator as well.,
1032015,"My baby is much smaller than babies his age. He would have accidents with all other brands except Pampers although he was well within the weight range of the diaper. In order to avoid the accident I would have to change the diaper as soon as it was wet. So, why save a few cents on a diaper when you can use less diapers with Pampers?",
1032016,"I have been using swaddlers by pampers for my first child and have continue using them for my second they continue to meet my expectations that I expect from pampers. Best diapers out there, and trust me I tried my fair share.",
1032017,"I bought these thinking that since my son was growing and moving around more that these might have a better fit to prevent leaks. I can't see any difference between these and the Swaddlers which have the wetness indicator, so I switched back to them!",
1032018,"We have been pleased overall with the Easy Ups Trainers for Girls. My daughter has loved being able to put them on herself. They are a little hard to get off without making a mess if they go #2, but I think that is probably to be expected regardless of the product.",
1032019,My daughter has very sensitive skin. This is the only product that doesn't bother her skin.,
1032020,We use these diapers every night and we have had no problems with leakage. He wears them for around 12 hours and although they are full in the morning we do not have any issues with them leaking onto the bed or his pajamas. We love the pampers brand and do not plan to ever use anything else.,
1032021,"Being a first time mom, I only wanted the best for my baby. Liked the quality of this diaper.",
1032022,These are outstanding for their intended use but also are wonderful to always have around to clean up anything. You can even take off your eye makeup with them!,
1032023,We fell in love with the swaddler diapers so it was only natural to move on to the cruisers when it was time. Our son loves them and these are the only brand of diapers we have used. They have been great and we have had no problems with them. Great fit and we love the different designs on them because it's always a surprise to see what he will wear next.,
1032024,We have been using these for 2 months now on our son and they are fantastic great value and amazing product.,
1032025,I absolutely love the swaddlers diapers. I have used them for both of my children!,
1032026,"The blue indicator strip is a great feature though not very necessary after size 2, since you learn to tell when the diaper is wet. The fabric of the diaper is soft and light but they have great absorbency. We have had a few incidences of wet and dirty leak but I have not heard of any diapers that haven't ever. Our baby is into size 4 now and we will still be using the Swaddlers in size 5!",
1032027,"We were given Pampers diapers as a baby shower gift and loved them. That is the only brand we wear in our house. The diapers keep him dry, he's able to move freely in them, and they fit great.",
1032028,"From the day my little guy was born, My husband and I took him home from the hospital in a Pampers diaper. I will say I did try other brands, and I always went back to Pampers. My son is now 1 yr and 4 months old and does sleep through the night now that I use Pampers baby dry. The best part is I do not even have to buy over night diapers, the Pampers Baby Dry work wonders! Other brands he wakes up wet. I love how they fit just snug enough so nothing leaks out. Thank you!",
1032029,I prefer Pampers diapers hands down. I've used them with both of my children and wouldn't recommend any other!,
